Comparative Financial Trend Analysis of U.S. Community Banks

Overview
This project presents a detailed financial analysis of three regional U.S. banks:

- The Federal Savings Bank (Chicago, IL)
- First Federal Bank of Louisiana (Lake Charles, LA)
- Fidelity Bank (New Orleans, LA)

The analysis is based on audited financial data retrieved from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) website, covering the fiscal years 2019 through 2023. It was developed to fulfill course requirements for FIN 4303 – Financial Markets and Institutions at Florida International University.

Objectives:
- To evaluate and compare the financial performance and stability of the selected banks.
- To identify trends in asset management, income generation, lending practices, and capital structure.
- To assess each bank's strategic focus based on product offerings, customer base, and operational efficiency.

Methodology
The report uses publicly available data from the FDIC, focusing on:

* Balance Sheet and Income Statement trends
* Key financial ratios such as Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Net Interest Margin, and Efficiency Ratio
* Loan portfolio composition, including real estate, commercial, consumer, and agricultural loans
* Deposits, borrowings, and capital adequacy
* Non-interest income and expense structures
* Each bank’s performance is compared year-over-year and benchmarked against its respective peer group as defined by FDIC classifications.

Key Findings:

 + Federal Savings Bank showed significant growth followed by volatility, particularly in non-interest income and total loans.

 + First Federal Bank of Louisiana demonstrated stable but conservative financial performance with limited fluctuations.

 + Fidelity Bank maintained consistent growth across assets and equity, with a notable focus on personalized and community-driven banking services.
